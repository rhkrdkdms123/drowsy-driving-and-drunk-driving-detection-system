# drowsy-driving-and-drunk-driving-detection-system

This work aims to prevent drunk driving and drowsy driving. The driver's central nervous system is suppressed, making them easily agitated, and their reaction time and judgment are impaired. As the ability to assess whether they are in a state capable of safe driving is significantly diminished, even the act of turning on the ignition and pressing the pedal can be a problem for a drunk driver. To address this issue, this work utilizes an alcohol detection sensor before the driver turns on the ignition and presses the pedal, allowing for testing. If the driver is in a state of intoxication, the ignition can be turned off.

Drowsy drivers may close their eyes and have difficulty maintaining focus on the road. They often become aware of their hazardous condition either just before or after an accident. To protect drivers in such states, a preventive system is needed to alert them when they are dozing off. In this work, a camera system using OpenCV is employed, along with a buzzer, to detect drowsiness and notify the driver of the impending danger.
